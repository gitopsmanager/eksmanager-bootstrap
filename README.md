# eksmanager-bootstrap

Terraform bootstrap for EKS Manager — provisions AWS infrastructure

## Prerequisites

- Terraform >= 1.5.0, plus `bash` (if using `setup-pipeline.sh`) or PowerShell 7.1+ (if using `setup-pipeline.ps1` — not Windows PowerShell 5.1, and not PowerShell 7.0 either; the GitHub App JWT signing needs .NET 5's `RSA.ImportFromPem`)

## Setup

Paste the env var block from the **Terraform tile** in your EKS Manager Settings page into your shell — it already includes a GitHub App scoped to your fork with the right permissions — then run:

```bash
./setup-pipeline.sh
```

or on Windows:

```powershell
.\setup-pipeline.ps1
```

This only sets up infrastructure — it doesn't clone anything, upload anything to S3, or start a build. The CodeBuild project stays idle until something uploads `eksmanager-bootstrap.zip` to the `eksmanager-bootstrap-<shared-services-account-id>` bucket this creates, which starts a build automatically (see the EventBridge note below).

If your shell's ambient AWS credentials aren't in the default profile/region (e.g. named SSO profiles), pass them explicitly — an `aws sso login` only refreshes the profile you logged into, it doesn't change what "ambient" means for a shell pointed elsewhere:

```bash
./setup-pipeline.sh --region eu-west-1 --profile AdministratorAccess-...
```

```powershell
.\setup-pipeline.ps1 -Region eu-west-1 -Profile AdministratorAccess-...
```

`--region`/`-Region` here only affects each script's own direct `aws` CLI calls and Terraform's credential resolution — it does not change which region your infrastructure gets created in (that's `REGION` → `shared_services_region`, set separately).

### What the script creates

- `EKSManagerBootstrap` in the management account, created directly by Terraform's default provider (your ambient credentials) — scoped to exactly what the `org` and `scp` Terraform submodules touch (not `AdministratorAccess` — see `iam/codebuild-pipeline-tf/policies/EKSManagerBootstrap-policy.json`)
- An S3 bucket named `eksmanager-bootstrap-<shared-services-account-id>`, versioned, with public access blocked
- `EKSManagerBootstrapSharedRole` — the CodeBuild service role, scoped to:
  - `cloudformation:*StackSet*` on `EKSManagerEnableAccountStackSet` only
  - `organizations:List*`/`Describe*` — read-only
  - `sts:AssumeRole` on `EKSManagerBootstrap`'s ARN only — this is how the root `aws/` module's default (management account) provider actually gets there when CodeBuild runs it later; CloudFormation StackSets trusted access and delegated admin registration are Terraform's job at that point (`aws/modules/org`), not this script's
  - Read-only S3 access to the bootstrap bucket (CodeBuild only ever reads the zip; nothing writes to GitHub or S3 at build time)
  - `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` on the M2M client secret
  - CloudWatch Logs for the CodeBuild project
  - VPC ENI permissions, needed to attach to your VPC
- A security group with no inbound rules, attached to the CodeBuild project
- A Secrets Manager secret `/EKSManagerBootstrap/client-m2m-cognito-secret` containing the M2M client secret — never stored as a plaintext CodeBuild environment variable
- A Secrets Manager secret `/EKSManagerBootstrap/github-app` containing the GitHub App credentials (`appId`, `installId`, base64 `privateKey`) as JSON — persisted so future automation can reuse them to re-clone and re-upload without needing the credentials passed in again. CodeBuild's own role has no access to this secret; it never touches GitHub
- The `eksmanager-bootstrap` CodeBuild project, S3-sourced, attached to your VPC, with `EKSMANAGER_CLIENT_ID`, `EKSMANAGER_COGNITO_URL` and `EKSMANAGER_API_URL` set as plaintext environment variables
- An EventBridge rule that starts a build whenever `eksmanager-bootstrap.zip` is uploaded to the bucket — see below
- `EKSManagerBootstrapGithubActionsRole`, trusted only when `.github/workflows/upload-to-s3.yml` is run from `var.github_repo`'s `main` branch, and scoped to `s3:PutObject` on `eksmanager-bootstrap.zip` only. Federated to a GitHub Actions OIDC provider for `token.actions.githubusercontent.com` — since an AWS account can only have one OIDC provider per URL, this is opt-in rather than auto-detected: leave `GITHUB_OIDC_PROVIDER_ARN` empty (default) and Terraform creates the provider; if the shared services account already has one, `apply` fails once with `EntityAlreadyExists` (nothing gets written to state on a failed create, so there's nothing to clean up) — just set `GITHUB_OIDC_PROVIDER_ARN` to the existing one's ARN and re-run

The secret lives under `/EKSManagerBootstrap/` rather than `/EKSManager/` — deliberately a separate namespace from where the running EKS Manager agent stores its own operational secrets. The SCP's `ProtectEKSManagerOperationalSecrets` statement only covers `/EKSManager/*`, so it has no opinion on these bootstrap-only credentials.

### Getting a zip into S3

Nothing in this repo uploads `eksmanager-bootstrap.zip` automatically — two independent, coexisting options exist once the script above has run:

- **`.github/workflows/upload-to-s3.yml`** in the fork — manually triggered (`workflow_dispatch`) from the GitHub Actions tab. `setup-pipeline.sh`/`.ps1` already set the three repository variables it needs (`AWS_ROLE_ARN`, `AWS_REGION`, `S3_BUCKET` — not secrets, none of these are sensitive) via the GitHub API, using the persisted GitHub App credentials (assumes that App has the Variables: Read & Write permission). Nothing to set up by hand. Uses OIDC — no long-lived AWS credential is stored in the fork.
- The GitHub App credentials persisted in Secrets Manager (above) — for whatever other automation you build later.

Either way, the upload starts a build automatically via the EventBridge rule.

### Shared services account access

Pure Terraform, one apply, no manual credential switching: the default provider creates `EKSManagerBootstrap` directly using your ambient (management account) credentials, and a second `aws.shared` provider assumes `SHARED_SERVICES_ROLE_NAME` (default `AWSControlTowerExecution` — the role Control Tower's Account Factory creates in every enrolled account) to create everything else. If the shared services account was created via plain AWS Organizations without Control Tower, set `SHARED_SERVICES_ROLE_NAME=OrganizationAccountAccessRole` instead. If the assumption fails, `apply` fails clearly on the first `aws.shared`-scoped resource — set `SHARED_SERVICES_ROLE_NAME` to whichever role is actually correct and re-run. No try-list, no pause-and-switch-credentials step.

### VPC attachment is required

`VPC_ID` and `SUBNET_IDS` are required, not optional. The EKS Manager API and most client AWS/GitHub endpoints are reached through an IP allowlist on the client's side. AWS-managed networking gives CodeBuild a different, unpredictable public IP on every single run — it cannot pass an IP allowlist, so the buildspec's `curl` calls to `EKSMANAGER_API_URL`/`EKSMANAGER_COGNITO_URL` would fail intermittently or permanently depending on how strict the allowlist is.

Use a private subnet routed through a NAT Gateway, and have the client allowlist that NAT Gateway's Elastic IP before the first build runs. The CodeBuild container itself has no inbound access at all — the security group created has zero ingress rules, only the egress needed to reach the EKS Manager API and AWS service endpoints via the NAT Gateway.

### Re-running

The script is idempotent — safe to re-run any time, e.g. to change the VPC/subnets, rotate the `EKSMANAGER_*` credentials, or update the persisted GitHub App credentials. It only re-applies Terraform; it never touches S3 content, so re-running it does not start a build. A build starts on its own whenever something uploads a new `eksmanager-bootstrap.zip` (via EventBridge), and applies directly — there's no manual approval step between plan and apply.

### Tearing down the aws/ module

Set `DESTROY_MODE=true` as a plaintext environment variable on the `eksmanager-bootstrap` CodeBuild project (not set by `setup-pipeline.sh` — add it yourself when you actually want this) and trigger a build: it empties the config S3 bucket and the `eksmanager` ECR repository (both lack `force_destroy`/`force_delete`, so a plain `terraform destroy` fails on either otherwise), then runs `terraform destroy -auto-approve` against the `aws/` module — no plan review, no approval gate, immediate. This tears down everything the pipeline creates: the agent instance, ECR repo, config bucket, Secrets Manager secret, SSM parameters, the CloudFormation StackSet and every instance it deployed, and the Organizations delegated-admin registration.

**Unset `DESTROY_MODE` before the next normal build** — it doesn't self-disable, and a build left with it set will destroy again instead of applying.

This only touches the `aws/` module's own state (`state/terraform.tfstate` in the `eksmanager-bootstrap-<account-id>` bucket) — it has no effect on the pipeline infrastructure itself (the CodeBuild project, IAM roles, the bucket). For that, use `setup-pipeline.sh --destroy` instead, documented above — the two are separate Terraform configurations with separate state, and neither tears down the other.

### `EKSManagerAdminRole` deploys to every account in a targeted OU, not just enrolled ones

The StackSet in `aws/modules/stackset` targets OUs (`organizational_unit_ids`), not individual accounts — the `SERVICE_MANAGED` permission model only reliably supports OU-level targeting (see the account-scoped targeting attempts, and why they were abandoned, in `aws/modules/stackset/main.tf`'s comments). That means `EKSManagerAdminRole` gets created in **every account CloudFormation finds in that OU**, including any account that isn't listed in `org_config` at all.

For an account in that position, the role is deliberately rendered useless rather than left with real access: the template's `AccountIsEnrolled` condition (`aws/modules/stackset/eksmanager-enable-account-stackset.yaml`) falls through to a `DefaultValue: "none"` region sentinel, which denies every service the role would otherwise use — EKS, EC2, ECR, KMS, SecretsManager, Logs, CloudWatch, AutoScaling, SSM, ELB — with one narrow exception: `ec2:DescribeRegions`, a read-only, no-resource-exposure lookup, kept only to satisfy IAM's requirement that a `NotAction` list can't be empty. The role exists, but there's nothing meaningful it can do.

This is a safety net, not a substitute for the right fix: **the actual solution is keeping a dedicated OU containing only accounts you intend to enroll**, so this fallback case never arises in the first place rather than being relied on. If the OU an account lives in also holds accounts unrelated to EKS Manager, consider moving the approved accounts into their own OU before enabling them here.

### Troubleshooting

**`apply` fails with `EntityAlreadyExists` on `aws_iam_openid_connect_provider.github_actions`** — the shared services account already has a GitHub Actions OIDC provider from something else (an AWS account can only have one per URL). Nothing gets written to state on a failed create, so there's nothing to clean up. Find the existing one:

```bash
aws iam list-open-id-connect-providers
```

then set `GITHUB_OIDC_PROVIDER_ARN` to its ARN (`arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:oidc-provider/token.actions.githubusercontent.com`) and re-run — Terraform federates `EKSManagerBootstrapGithubActionsRole` to that existing provider instead of trying to create a new one.

**`apply` fails on the first `aws.shared`-scoped resource with an assume-role error** — `SHARED_SERVICES_ROLE_NAME` (default `AWSControlTowerExecution`) isn't the right role for this account. If the account was created via plain AWS Organizations without Control Tower, set `SHARED_SERVICES_ROLE_NAME=OrganizationAccountAccessRole` and re-run — see "Shared services account access" above.

## Architecture — what's confirmed

`setup-pipeline.sh`/`.ps1` is a one-time, one-shot script run from the management account — pure Terraform underneath, one `apply`, no manual role creation or credential switching. Terraform's default provider creates `EKSManagerBootstrap` directly in the management account (your ambient credentials); a second `aws.shared` provider assumes a single, static role (see "Shared services account access" below) to create everything else: the S3 bucket, `EKSManagerBootstrapSharedRole`, the CodeBuild project, and the EventBridge trigger. The script does not clone your fork, does not create or upload anything to S3, and does not start or trigger a build. CloudFormation StackSets trusted access and delegated admin registration happen later, as Terraform (`aws/modules/org`), when CodeBuild actually runs the root `aws/` bootstrap module — not as part of this script, so it isn't registered by two separate mechanisms.

The **GitHub App** credentials (`GITHUB_APP_ID` / `GITHUB_APP_INSTALL_ID` / `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`, all environment variables) are passed to Terraform, which persists them to Secrets Manager for whatever later clones the fork and uploads `eksmanager-bootstrap.zip` — that upload is what actually starts a build (via the EventBridge rule). The script also uses these credentials itself, right after `terraform apply`, to mint an installation token and set the `AWS_ROLE_ARN`/`AWS_REGION`/`S3_BUCKET` repository variables on the fork (assumes the App has the Variables: Read & Write permission — see "Getting a zip into S3" below). The CodeBuild project itself is **S3-sourced** and never touches GitHub. There is no GitHub PAT anywhere in this repo.

## Entra SAML SSO

Set up separately via `azure-saml/` — it does not have a `topology.json` flag since it is not part of the Terraform install. See `azure-saml/README.md` for full instructions.

## eksmanager-prefix-lists pipeline

A second, independent CodeBuild project — manages EC2 managed prefix lists and
the security group rules that reference them, across every client account and
region. Now wired into `setup-pipeline.sh`/`.ps1` alongside the bootstrap
module's own apply.

**Implemented:**
- The CodeBuild project, its service role (`EKSManagerPrefixListsSharedRole`),
  the S3 bucket, and the two EventBridge triggers that start a build when
  `org-changes.zip` or `add-cluster.zip` is uploaded — each overrides the
  project's source at start time via `sourceLocationOverride`, so the two
  artifact types never race to overwrite a shared object.
- `terraform/org-changes/` — one `aws_ec2_managed_prefix_list` per granular
  list (see `example-prefix-lists.json`), deployed to every (account, region)
  pair in `topology.json`, with `create_before_destroy` + a hash-triggered
  replace on any entry change.
- `terraform/add-cluster/` — `data` source lookups of those same granular
  lists by name, plus one security group ingress rule per (security group,
  prefix list) pair for a single cluster (see `example-clusters.json`).
- `scripts/generate_org_changes.py` / `scripts/generate_add_cluster.py` /
  `scripts/generate_destroy_cluster.py` — render each build's literal
  `buildspec.yml` (a `build-list` batch for org-changes, one per-cluster
  build for add-cluster/destroy-cluster — no CodeBuild `dynamic` matrix;
  that mechanism has a documented env-var propagation gap) and stage the
  Terraform module + its `.auto.tfvars.json` alongside it.
- `.github/workflows/org-changes.yml` / `add-cluster.yml` / `destroy-cluster.yml`
  — run the generators and upload the resulting zip via OIDC, same pattern
  as `upload-to-s3.yml`.

**`org-changes.yml` is `workflow_dispatch`-only, deliberately not triggered
on push and not chained after bootstrap succeeds.** An org-changes run
replaces prefix lists across every enabled account and region in one batch —
worth a human running it after reviewing what changed in `topology.json` or
`prefix-lists.json`, not something that fires automatically.

**`add-cluster.yml` takes an explicit `cluster_name` input**, dispatched by
whatever's driving cluster creation (the GUI, via the GitHub API) — not
inferred by diffing `clusters.json`, which breaks down for deletions and
multi-cluster commits.

**`destroy-cluster.yml` takes `account_id`/`region`/`cluster_name` directly
as inputs, not read from `clusters.json`.** Tears down exactly one cluster's
SG rules (`terraform destroy` against the same `terraform/add-cluster`
state that cluster's `add-cluster.yml` run created) — nothing else. This
avoids an ordering dependency: works whether `clusters.json` still has the
entry, never had it, or had it removed first. Uploads to the same
`add-cluster.zip` key/trigger as `add-cluster.yml` — same module, just
`destroy` instead of `apply` baked into the generated buildspec, so no new
S3 key or EventBridge rule was needed.

**Config files needed (same pattern as `topology.json`):** copy
`example-prefix-lists.json` → `prefix-lists.json` and
`example-clusters.json` → `clusters.json`, fill in, commit to your fork.

## After bootstrap

- `EKSManagerBootstrap` is scoped to the management-account permissions the bootstrap actually needs (not `AdministratorAccess`), so it's safe to leave in place for future re-runs or upgrades. Delete it if you'd rather minimize standing infrastructure
- The agent VM is now connected and manages all resources via its instance profile
